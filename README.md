# 🌍 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Description
This project analyzes Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) data — covering over 8,000 international projects focused on emissions reduction — to evaluate global sustainability performance under the Kyoto Protocol. Built using Power BI, Python (Pandas, Jupyter), and Excel, the project integrates multiple data sources from the UNFCCC CDM dataset from their official website to draw actionable insights for policy, finance, and climate impact. It demonstrates strong skills in data analysis, dashboard creation, and policy-driven storytelling, particularly suited for development economics and environmental governance contexts.

## 🧭 Project Overview
This analysis aims to:

Visualize project distribution and Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) across countries.

Understand the financial characteristics of different CDM project types.

Segment countries based on IRR (Internal Rate of Return), capital investment, and issuance performance.

Identify which projects are most effective and scalable in reducing emissions, especially in Least Developed Countries (LDCs).

## 🗂️ Dataset Structure (Source: UNFCCC)
CDM Activities: Main table containing registration details, crediting periods, methodologies, financials (investment, IRR), and CER projections.

Issuances: Records of actual CER issuance events linked to each project.

CPA Info: Additional information for programmatic activities (PoAs), including inclusion dates and sub-national info.

Prior Consideration: Dates of intent submission before formal CDM registration.

Country Codes: Reference for ISO2 and country names.

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Insights
### 🌍 Geographic & Temporal Trends
Top countries by CERs issued: India, China, and Brazil dominate with over 300 million CERs combined.

Projects are most active between 2006–2012, coinciding with Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period.

### 📈 Financial & Project Effectiveness
Projects with higher IRR (10%+) tend to cluster in middle-income regions, suggesting cost-effective impact.

Total capital investment varies significantly, with hydro and wind projects showing strong returns per dollar invested.

LDCs often show lower IRR but high additional revenue potential, justifying grant-based interventions.

### 📅 Crediting Period and Issuance Gap
Many projects are delayed in issuance despite being registered — particularly in CP2 and CP3, implying bureaucratic or monitoring delays.

### 💰 O&M Costs and Revenue Potential
Projects with low O&M (< $1M/year) and high CERs issued (e.g., landfill gas recovery) are among the most efficient.

Programs of Activities (PoAs) offer scaling potential through replicable micro-projects across developing countries.

## 💡 Recommendations
Prioritize PoAs in LDCs — they enable scalable impact with lower administrative burden.

Support high-IRR, low-investment projects like small hydro and biomass in mid-income countries.

Use RMF-style (Recency, Monetary, Frequency) logic to monitor countries that regularly issue CERs and target support where performance lags.

Encourage public-private investment in high-return but underfunded subtypes (e.g., cookstove PoAs in Africa).
